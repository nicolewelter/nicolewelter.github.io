## Bio
Hello! My name is Nicole Welter. I am currently a senior at Eastern  Washington University, who will be graduating summa cum laude with a double major in Technical Communications and Visual Communication Design. As a naturally curious individual, I  pride myself on learning the process of why something is done, rather than just focusing on the final product. Design and communication have allowed me to explore this  curiosity of the why factor and be able to effectively understand what is occurring within each system and how to improve on it.
